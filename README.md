I mainly created this for the sake of having a more professional github account (I have an old one with a dumb name), so I am creating a new one with a fresher outlook
- 👀 I’m interested in:
Mainly cryptology, databases, machine learning and low-level programming (though my skills in assembly are abyssmal)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
More like re-learning a lot of linear algebra, with the end goal writing my own linear program solver
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
Nothing at the moment
